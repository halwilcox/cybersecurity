Yahoo was breached back in 2017. 3 billion user accounts that included all passwords were affected. Typically the motivation behind password breaches are to gain access the the users account so they can have access to sensitive information. Hackers gained access to Yahoo's network through the use of a phishing scheme. All it took was one employee with network access clicking on a malicious link for a hacker to get through. Once they were in the hackers were able to have full access to their network. Yahoo was also storing unencrypted security questions and answers. This remains one of the largest data breaches in history.
